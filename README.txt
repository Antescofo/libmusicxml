INSTALL

MacOS
	copy the libmusicxml2.framework to /Library/Frameworks 
Windows
	copy the libmusicxml2.dll along with your application
Linux
	copy the library to /usr/local/lib or to /usr/lib
	binaries are compiled for 64 bits architectures on Ubuntu 11.10
	you should get the src code (from the package of from git) 
	and compile on your platform

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform specific makefiles are included for historic reasons but they are 
not maintained any more. Please use cmake to generate native projects and makefiles.

Note: 
 the library is still named libmusicxml2. It doesn't refer to the version 
 number but to the significant architecture change that has been introduced with 
 the version 2 of the library. The name has been kept for compatibility reasons 
 and because there is no change from architecture viewpoint.

Note for windows developers: 
 You must be carefull with the runtime boundary issue : you can't allocate memory 
 (either explicitly with new or malloc, or implicitly) and then pass a pointer across 
 a DLL boundary to be freed (see at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460.aspx).
 The rule is to use the same runtime library than libmusicxml.dll. You can look at the 
 runtime it uses using depends.exe. The easy way is to use the same development environment.
 Otherwise, you should get the source code and recompile the library using your compiler.
